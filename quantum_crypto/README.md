# Quantum-Secured Cryptocurrency Project

This project outlines a hypothetical implementation of a quantum-secured cryptocurrency leveraging Google's Willow quantum chip. The implementation follows the SPARC Framework, encompassing Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, and Completion phases.

## Directory Structure
- **specification/**: Project objectives, requirements, user scenarios, UI/UX guidelines, and technology stack.
- **pseudocode/**: High-level pseudocode outlining the application's logic and flow.
- **architecture/**: System architecture details and diagrams.
- **refinement/**: Notes and documentation related to performance improvements and maintainability.
- **completion/**: Final testing, documentation, and deployment preparations.
- **src/**: Source code for quantum and classical integration.
- **config/**: Configuration files and environment settings.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-currency-project.git
    cd quantum-currency-project
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
    - Copy the sample environment file:
