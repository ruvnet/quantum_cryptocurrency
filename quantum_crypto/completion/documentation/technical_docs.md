- **quantum_hash.py**: Implements the quantum hashing function for transaction integrity.
- **quantum_merkle_tree.py**: Constructs and verifies the Quantum Merkle Tree.
- **quantum_block.py**: Manages block creation and assembly with quantum proofs.
- **quantum_consensus.py**: Defines the consensus mechanism utilizing quantum verification.
- **quantum_resource_manager.py**: Interfaces with the Willow quantum chip for quantum operations.

### Classical Integration
- **node.py**: Represents a network node responsible for handling blocks and transactions.
- **network.py**: Manages peer-to-peer communication between nodes.
- **storage.py**: Handles the storage and retrieval of blockchain data.
- **transactions.py**: Manages the creation, validation, and serialization of transactions.

## APIs

### Quantum Resource Manager API
- **initialize_quantum_state(data)**: Initializes the quantum state with given data.
- **apply_gates(state, gates)**: Applies a sequence of quantum gates to the state.
- **measure_state(state)**: Measures the quantum state to obtain a deterministic hash.

### Node API
- **add_transaction(tx)**: Adds a new transaction to the pending pool.
- **create_block()**: Creates a new block from pending transactions.
- **validate_block(block)**: Validates a block using quantum proofs.

## Security Considerations
