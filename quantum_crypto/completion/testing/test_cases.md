# Test Cases

## Unit Tests
1. **Quantum Hash Determinism**
   - **Description**: Ensure that the quantum_hash function produces consistent outputs for the same input.
   - **Input**: "sender=alice&receiver=bob&amount=10"
   - **Expected Output**: Consistent hash value across multiple executions.

2. **Key Generation Validity**
   - **Description**: Verify that generated keys are valid and meet quantum-resistance criteria.
   - **Input**: None (key generation process)
   - **Expected Output**: Valid private and public key pair.

## Integration Tests
1. **Transaction to Block Flow**
   - **Description**: Validate that transactions are correctly hashed and included in a block.
   - **Input**: A set of valid transactions.
   - **Expected Output**: A block containing all transactions with a valid Merkle root and quantum proof.

## System Tests
1. **End-to-End Transaction Validation**
   - **Description**: Test the full lifecycle from transaction creation to block validation and ledger update.
   - **Input**: Multiple transactions from different users.
   - **Expected Output**: All transactions are validated, included in a block, and the ledger is updated accordingly.
