# Deployment Instructions

## Steps

1. **Update `.env` File**
   - Ensure all environment variables in `config/.env` are correctly set.

2. **Build Docker Images**
    ```bash
    docker-compose build
    ```

3. **Start Services**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. **Verify Services**
    - Use Docker logs to verify that all services are running as expected:
        ```bash
        docker-compose logs -f
        ```

## Post-Deployment
- **Monitor Logs**: Continuously monitor service logs for any anomalies.
- **Health Checks**: Implement health checks to ensure all services are operational.
- **Scaling**: Adjust Docker Compose configurations to scale services as needed.
