# Performance Improvements

- **Quantum Circuit Depth Reduction**: 
  Review gate sequences in `quantum_hash.py` to reduce circuit depth and minimize decoherence.

- **Caching Intermediate Results**:
  Cache frequently used classical computations (e.g., transaction serialization) to reduce overhead.

- **Parallel Validation**:
  Allow multiple nodes or quantum chips to validate different parts of the Merkle tree simultaneously.
