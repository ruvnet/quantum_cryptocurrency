# Maintainability Refactors

- **Modular Code Structure**:
  Refactor code in `quantum_currency/` to ensure each module has a single responsibility.

- **Documentation**:
  Add comprehensive docstrings and comments to all functions and classes.

- **Automated Testing**:
  Implement unit and integration tests to cover all critical components.

- **Code Linting**:
  Integrate linters (e.g., pylint, flake8) to maintain code quality and consistency.
