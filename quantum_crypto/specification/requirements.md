# Requirements

## Functional Requirements
1. The system must generate quantum-resistant keys for all users.
2. The system must produce a quantum Merkle proof for each block.
3. The system must validate transactions using a quantum-based hashing function.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Minimize coherence time overhead with optimized quantum circuits.
2. **Security**: Employ quantum-resistant cryptography and error correction.
3. **Maintainability**: Code should be modular with clear interfaces.
4. **Compatibility**: The blockchain network should allow classical nodes to participate.
