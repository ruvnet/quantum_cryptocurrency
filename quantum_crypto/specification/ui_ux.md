# UI/UX Guidelines

## Design Principles
1. **Simplicity**: Ensure the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate for users of all technical backgrounds.
2. **Transparency**: Quantum operations should be seamless and hidden from the user to maintain simplicity.
3. **Security Indicators**: Clearly display security statuses, such as key generation and transaction validation.
4. **Responsiveness**: Interface should be responsive and provide real-time feedback on actions.

## User Interface Components
- **Dashboard**: Overview of user balance, recent transactions, and blockchain status.
- **Transaction Page**: Form to create and send new transactions.
- **Wallet Management**: Interface to view and manage quantum-resistant keys.
- **Block Explorer**: Tool to explore blocks and transactions within the blockchain.
